        In my free time, I stay physically active by working out at the gym and going for runs.

        Furthermore, I love to read and do it a lot. Since I am half Finnish &#x1F1EB;&#x1F1EE;, I like to read books
        in the Finnish languague to improve my language proficiency. Moreover, I have always been
        passionately interested in history, geopolitics and maps &#127758; in general.
