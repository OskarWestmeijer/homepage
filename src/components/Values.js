                    <h2>Values</h2>
                    <p>Company culture is very important. I believe that sharing the same fundamental values with your
                        colleagues, builds trust and general well-being at work.</p>
                    <p>Personally I put great emphasize into reliability, transparency, openness and honesty.</p>
                    <h4>Making decisions</h4>
                    <p>Solving a problem together as a team is always challenging. Everyone has a viewpoint and sometimes
                        these just do not seem to align very well. I tend to ask my peers what is on their
                        mind and how they would solve the situation. Ideally this opinion is shared with the whole team. This
                        way everyone is heard, and we can gain a common understanding.</p>
                    <p>Based on these viewpoints we can decide in a rational and democratic way the best solution. Should I
                        still disagree with the chosen solution, I will voice my concerns. But it is even more important to
                        accept and trust the team decision.
                        Only in extreme cases would I insist on a prolonged discussion.</p>
