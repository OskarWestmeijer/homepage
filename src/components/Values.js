                    <p>I try to maintain a strong moral compass. Openness and honesty are fundamental values to me. Unfairness and egoism are characteristics which I oppose.</p>

                    <p>I communicate frequently with my colleagues on how to solve technical challenges.
                        Gaining a common understanding and working toward the same goal is important to me.</p>

                    <p>I like working with users of the software. I think it is important to figure out requirements and understand the business processes.

                        continuously presenting them to the stakeholders.</p>
