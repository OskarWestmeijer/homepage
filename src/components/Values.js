        <div className="container pt-5 mt-4">
            <div className="row">
                <div className="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"></div>
                <div className="col-lg-8 col-sm-12">
                    <h2 className="text-center display-6">Values</h2>
                    <h5 >Personal</h5>
                    <p>I try to maintain a strong moral compass. Openness and honesty are fundamental values to me. Unfairness and egoism are characteristics which I strongly oppose.
                        I would rather fail or be in a worse position, than to compromise my integrity.</p>

                    <h5>Company culture</h5>
                    <p>A reliable and transparent workplace is important. Sharing common values with your
                        colleagues, builds trust and general well-being at work. A healthy culture also means, embracing the diversity among the employees.</p>

                    <h5>Team decision making</h5>
                    <p>Solving a problem as a team is always challenging. Every teammate has a viewpoint, but sometimes
                        they do not seem to align very well. I tend to ask my peers what is on their
                        mind and how they would solve the task. Ideally this opinion is shared with the whole team. This
                        way everyone is heard, and we can gain a common understanding. Minimize the room for misunderstandings.</p>
                    <h5>Working with the stakeholders</h5>
                    <p>I like working with the stakeholders. It is fun to figure out requirements and understand the business processes.
                        In most projects we had great results pursuing an incremental development style. This means implementing small features every sprint and
                        continuously presenting them to the stakeholders. It feels fulfilling to develop stable and thought-out tooling for the users.</p>
