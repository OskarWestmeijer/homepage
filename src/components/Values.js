                    <h5 >Personal</h5>
                    <p>I try to maintain a strong moral compass. Openness and honesty are fundamental values to me. Unfairness and egoism are characteristics which I strongly oppose.
                        I would rather fail or be in a worse position, than to compromise my integrity.</p>
                    <h5>Company culture</h5>
                    <p>A reliable and secure workplace is important. Sharing common values with your
                        colleagues, builds trust and general well-being at work. A healthy company culture means, to embrace diversity among employees.</p>
                    <h5>Communicating with the team</h5>
                    <p>I communicate frequently with my colleagues on how to solve technical challenges.
                        Gaining a common understanding and working toward the same goal is important to me. Minimize the room for misunderstandings.</p>
                    <h5>Working with the stakeholders</h5>
                    <p>I like working with the stakeholders. It is fun to figure out requirements and understand the business processes.
                        In most projects we had great results pursuing an incremental development style. This means implementing small features every sprint and
                        continuously presenting them to the stakeholders.</p>
