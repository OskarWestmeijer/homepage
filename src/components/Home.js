                            <p>Hello! This website shares information regarding my personal experiences and interests.</p>
                            <p>In 2018 I completed my apprenticeship as a software developer and am pursuing a career as a Java
                                developer
                                ever since.</p>
                            <p>Currently I am living in the beautiful old town of Luebeck, Germany.
                                In my free time I like to exercise, a lot! This is a passion I discovered during the covid pandemic.
                                Bouldering, yoga, lifting and running are my main interests. Furthermore I like to read books and
                                travel. Besides this, I also code in my free time. This website is running on my own server and I
                                maintain a dockerized Java application setup in the background.</p>
                            <p>My heritage is mixed, mother finnish, father dutch, I was born in Finland, but I grew up in
                                Germany.
                                I have a strong affinity for these three cultures and share great interest in getting to know others as
                                well.
                                This understanding has been beneficial in culturally diverse teams.</p>
                            <p>Feel free to explore this website, to learn more about me and use the links to have a look at my accounts.</p>
