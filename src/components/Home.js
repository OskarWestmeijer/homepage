                    <p>Hello! On this website I share information regarding my personal experiences and interests.</p>
                    <p>In 2018 I completed my apprenticeship as a software developer and am pursuing a career as a Java
                        developer
                        ever since.</p>
                    <p>Currently I am living in the beautiful old town of Luebeck, Germany.
                        In my free time I like to exercise, a lot! This is a passion I discovered during the covid pandemic.
                        Bouldering, yoga, lifting and running are my main interests. Furthermore I like to read novels and
                        travel. Besides this, I also code in my free time. This website is running on my own server and I
                        maintain a Java application setup in the background.</p>
                    <p>My heritage is mixed, my mother is finnish, father dutch, I was born in Finland, but I grew up in
                        Germany.
                        I have a strong affinity for these three cultures and share great interest in getting to know others as
                        well.
                        This understanding has been beneficial in culturally diverse teams.</p>

                        accounts.</p>
